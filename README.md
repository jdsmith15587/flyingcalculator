This is a gag program I am building just for fun that calculates how much money you could have made if the money you spent on your flying hobby was invested in the S&P 500 instead.   It will look at the following variables to make it's estimation
* S&P500 returns for the period you flew
* The time period your flew from date and to date
* Your total flight time in hours
* Your average number of flight hours per year
* Your average cost per flight hour

Here are some simple user stories which outline the functional requirements:

As a user I can enter my total flight hours so that the program can estimate the money I have spent on flying

As a user I can enter an average cost per flight hour so that the program can estimate the money I have spent flying

As a user I can enter the year I started flying and the year I ended flying so that the program knows when to begin the simulated investment time period

As a user I can enter the average number of flight hours per year since I started flying so that the program can correctly allocate the dollars spent on flying across the simulated investment time period

As a user I can see how much money I could have made over that period that I flew if I had invested the money in the S&P500 so that I know how much money I wasted
